# OnCollaboration

## Overview
**OnCollaboration** is an initiative focused on improving collaboration and knowledge sharing between Dutch and Indonesian radiation therapists. By facilitating knowledge transfer, exchange programs, and continuous networking, the project aims to enhance the quality of radiotherapy in Indonesia, particularly in underserved regions.

## Background
In Indonesia, radiotherapy resources are limited:
- **6 Radiation Oncologists**
- **8 Clinical Physicists**
- **24 Technicians**
- **3 Linear Accelerators (Linacs)** serving **65 patients per day each**
- Approximately **2,700 new patients** treated annually in Yogyakarta (a city of 10 million inhabitants).

### Global Contrast
- **15,000 radiotherapy machines** worldwide:
  - **9%** located in low-income countries
  - **63%** located in high-income countries
- Indonesia has **400 million people** with access to radiotherapy primarily on the island of Java.

## Project Goals
OnCollaboration seeks to:
1. **Enhance knowledge sharing**: Provide easy access to research, clinical techniques, and best practices.
2. **Foster cross-pollination**: Promote collaboration between Dutch and Indonesian professionals to improve radiotherapy techniques.
3. **Implement exchange programs**: Offer educational exchange programs to upskill Indonesian radiation therapy professionals.
4. **Build continuous support networks**: Create strong networks for ongoing professional consultation and support.

## Solutions Explored
- **Improving quality** of radiotherapy in Indonesia through structured knowledge exchange.
- **Educational programs**: Offering training and development opportunities to Indonesian radiotherapy professionals.
- **Networking for support**: Building long-term connections for professional advice and shared expertise.

## Success Stories
The OnCollaboration project has already developed a successful webinar platform:
- **60-100 participants** per webinar session
- Accredited by **Perhimpunan Onkologi Radiasi Indonesia (PORI)**
- The most recent webinar saw **200 participants**, including not only oncologists but also other healthcare professionals.

## Conclusion
OnCollaboration provides a crucial platform for knowledge sharing and skill development between Dutch and Indonesian radiotherapy professionals. By improving access to advanced techniques and fostering collaboration, the project works toward more equitable cancer care in Indonesia and other low-income regions.
