Project: OnCollaboration â€“ Improved Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing Between Dutch and Indonesian Radiation Therapists

The OnCollaboration project focuses on developing an innovative solution to enhance collaboration and knowledge sharing between Dutch and Indonesian radiation therapists. This initiative aims to improve the quality of radiotherapy in Indonesia through knowledge transfer, exchange programs, and fostering networks for ongoing support.

Background
In Indonesia, there are currently 6 radiation oncologists, 8 clinical physicists, and 24 technicians working with only 3 linear accelerators (linacs). Each linac treats an average of 65 patients per day, amounting to approximately 2,700 new patients annually in Yogyakarta, a city with 10 million inhabitants. However, access to radiotherapy is limited: only around 400 million people in Indonesia, mainly on the island of Java, have reasonable access to these treatments.

The global contrast is stark: of the 15,000 radiotherapy machines worldwide, only 9% are located in low-income countries, while 63% are available in high-income countries. This highlights the disparity in access to essential cancer care and the need for better distribution of technology and knowledge in regions like Indonesia.

Goals of OnCollaboration
The goal of OnCollaboration is to create a platform where knowledge can be easily transferred, for example, on the latest research developments and clinical techniques from the Netherlands. This will foster cross-pollination in the collaboration between the Netherlands and Asia, giving Indonesian radiotherapy professionals access to the latest innovations and best practices.

Possible solutions explored by the project include:

Improving the quality of radiotherapy through knowledge sharing.
Educational exchange programs to upskill Indonesian professionals.
Building networks for ongoing support and consultation.
Successful Webinars and Educational Programs
OnCollaboration has already developed a successful platform for webinars, with 60-100 participants attending each session, accredited by the Perhimpunan Onkologi Radiasi Indonesia (PORI). The latest webinar attracted as many as 200 participants, including not only radiation oncologists but also other healthcare professionals. These sessions are aimed at continuous professional development and form a crucial part of the project's broader mission to make high-quality care more accessible to patients in Indonesia.

Conclusion
OnCollaboration offers a valuable way to promote knowledge sharing and elevate radiotherapy in Indonesia. Through intensive collaboration between the Netherlands and Indonesia, both technical expertise and access to radiotherapy in Indonesia can be significantly improved. This project represents a step toward more inclusive and accessible cancer care for millions of people in low-income countries.
